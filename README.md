# JavaScript Interview Practice Sets

This folder contains a **curated collection of JavaScript interview practice questions** that I use to strengthen my core JS concepts and prepare for technical interviews.

The questions are focused on **logic building, concept clarity, and real interview patterns** rather than rote learning.

## Purpose of This Folder

- Practice **JavaScript fundamentals to advanced concepts**
- Prepare for **frontend / full-stack developer interviews**
- Improve **problem-solving and debugging skills**
- Build strong **conceptual understanding** of how JavaScript works internally

## Topics Covered

The practice sets may include questions related to:

- JavaScript Basics (variables, data types, operators)
- Scope, Hoisting & Closures
- `this` keyword & Execution Context

## How to Use

1. Pick one file/topic at a time
2. Try to **solve questions without looking at answers**
3. Write explanations in your own words
4. Revisit tricky questions regularly
5. Use this as a **revision cheat-sheet before interviews**

## Goal

My goal is to become a **confident JavaScript developer** who understands _why_ things work — not just _how_.

This repository reflects my **learning journey and interview preparation mindset**.
